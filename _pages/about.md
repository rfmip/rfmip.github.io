**The Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP)** is a model intercomparison project designed to diagnose effective radiative forcing and evaluate its uncertainty in Global Climate Models.

As part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 7 (CMIP7), the second iteration of the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP2.0) consists of a series of fixed-Sea Surface Temperature simulations aimed at addressing the following questions:

1. What is the present-day radiative forcing, and its key anthropogenic contributors, since pre-industrial times?
2. What is the temporal evolution of the radiative forcing, and its components, over the historical period and into the future?
3. What is the influence of the underlying climate state on radiative forcing?
4. To what extent is radiative forcing separable from radiative feedbacks when considering land processes?
