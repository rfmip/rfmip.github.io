The Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) is a model intercomparison project designed to diagnose effective radiative forcing and evaluate its uncertainty in Global Climate Models.

As part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 7 (CMIP7), the second iteration of the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP2.0) will launch shortly. Please stay tuned for further annoucements.
