A change in the composition of the climate system, stemming from natural or anthropogenic activities, can induce a perturbation to the Earthâ€™s radiative energy budget known as a radiative forcing. The characteristics of this forcing, such as its global-mean magnitude and spatial pattern, determine the subsequent climate response.

RFMIP is a model intercomparison project designed to diagnose radiative forcing and evaluate its uncertainty in Global Climate Models.

As part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 7 (CMIP7), the second iteration of the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP2.0) will enable the systematic characterization of effective radiative forcing and its components across state-of-the-art climate models, through a set of fixed-Sea Surface Temperature timeslice and transient experiments. The protocol for RFMIP2.0 will be presented here shortly.
