We are thrilled to be hosting a general Radiative Forcing session at the CMIP 2026 Community Workshop, March 9-13 2026, in Kyoto, Japan and virtually.

Please consider submitting an abstract to our session "#4 Exploring Radiative Forcing in Models and Observations to Understand Climate Change" by the upcoming deadline August 13th 1200 UTC, following the links at this address: https://cmip2026.org/programme/abstracts/

The session is inspired by the upcoming CMIP7 iteration of the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP2.0; rollout coming soon!), but certainly not limited to it. We welcome any abstract focused on the diagnosis, study, or application of radiative forcing in models and observations. The full session description is provided below.
